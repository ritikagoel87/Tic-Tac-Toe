Project Description
-------------------
Tic-Tac-Toe is the Project 0 for Software Engineering Immersive (SEI) 31 at General Assembly. It takes place in the 3rd week of the course under the supervision of Joel Turnbull (Instructor) and Yianni Moustakas (Teaching Assistant). This is the first project made by the each person in the team using basic technologies mentioned above.


How The Game Works
------------------
  This is a 2-player game.
  Players can select a name or an icon of their choice to represent them in the game.
  Each player takes turns to mark their moves.
  Player 1 makes the first move.
  Whoever first marks 3 places on the same row, same column, diagonally left-top to right-bottom or left-bottom to right-top wins the game.
  The scores are preserved on the system.
  The scores would be constantly maintained even when the browser is re-loaded unless the players want to Reset the score ( which is an option provided ).


Major Features
--------------
The major features of the game include:
  Change Tokens - The players can choose a name or an icon of their choose to play the game. A lit of the options is provided. However, they are not allowed to do it while the game is on!
  Multiple Games Provision - Players can play any number of games by choosing to Replay.
  Score Keeping - The scores are preserved even if the window is re-loaded, unless the players wish to reset them.


List Of Any Known Bugs
----------------------
Following bugs are known to exist in the code and are currently being looked into:
  If one of the player tries to select the same token as the other player, the token for the later changes to the player number by default.



Wishlist/Future features
------------------------
The following features are on the agenda to be included in the current game of Tic-Tac-Toe:
  Custom Game Board - Having a provision to be able to select a desired board size from the list or enter custom board size by the players.
  Support Networked Multiplayer - To enable players to play on different systems and still manage to be connected to the same round of games.
  Creating AI Opponent - Enabling a 1 player game who can play with the Computer instead of pretending to be 2 different players and taking turns for both.
