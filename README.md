About the game
--------------
Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (British English) or Xs and Os, is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. X starts first!


How The Game Works
------------------
  This is a 2-player game.
  Players can select a name or an icon of their choice to represent them in the game.
  Each player takes turns to mark their moves.
  Player 1 makes the first move.
  Whoever first marks 3 places on the same row, same column, diagonally left-top to right-bottom or left-bottom to right-top wins the game.
  The scores are preserved on the system.
  The scores would be constantly maintained even when the browser is re-loaded unless the players want to Reset the score ( which is an option provided ).
